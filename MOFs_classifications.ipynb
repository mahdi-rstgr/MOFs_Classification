    "## Machine learning for discovery of MOFs for Carbon Capture\n",
    "\n",
    "In this projetc, I will build machine learning classification models to identify promising metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) for carbon capture applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Carbon capture is a complex challenge involving multiple material considerations — including pore geometry, surface chemistry, mechanical and thermal stability, water stability, and economic feasibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the problem tractable, I will focus on two experimentally measurable properties that strongly influence performance:\n",
    "1) CO₂ uptake at low pressure, which reflects adsorption capacity and selectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Water stability, which determines a material’s long-term durability and reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of project, I’ll have trained and evaluated models that can distinguish between promising and non-promising MOFs based on these properties — demonstrating how data-driven methods can accelerate materials discovery."
